Neural network for predicting whether a given RGB value corresponds to morning, evening, or night, we can make a few adjustments:

Input: The RGB values will be the input features.
Output: The output will have 3 nodes, corresponding to the classes: morning, evening, and night.
Training Data: We'll need to define some example RGB values for morning, evening, and night.

Morning: Brighter colors, higher values in the RGB spectrum.
Evening: Warmer tones, higher values in the red and yellow spectrum.
Night: Darker colors, lower RGB values.
